# Weather Data Analysis Project

# Tasks :
1.Descriptive Statistics:
Compute and present basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, and Evaporation.

2.Time Series Visualization:
Create a line chart to show the variations in weather variables over time, identifying trends or patterns.

3.Correlation Analysis:
Calculate and visualize correlations between MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, and Evaporation using a heatmap.

4.Rainfall Distribution:
Illustrate the distribution of rainfall through a histogram or kernel density plot, highlighting common levels and outliers.

5.Seasonal Analysis:
Analyze average values of weather variables across different seasons and visualize seasonal patterns with bar graphs.

Results:
Include any important findings or insights from the data analysis.
